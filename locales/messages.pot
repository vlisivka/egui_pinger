msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:600
msgid "- Mean (Average): The sum of all RTTs divided by the number of packets. Good for general trends, but can be misleading if you have rare, massive 'lags'."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:601
msgid "- Median (Middle Value): We sort all results and pick the one in the middle. This is the 'typical' experience. If you have 100 packets and 1 of them is very slow, the Median stays the same, while the Mean jumps up."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:602
msgid "- 95th Percentile (P95): This shows the worst-case scenario for 95% of your traffic. If P95 is low, your connection is stable. If it's much higher than the Median, your connection is 'jittery' and prone to sudden lags."

msgid "VoIP Impact:"
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:606
msgid "Voice is a real-time stream. If latency is over 150ms, you start to notice a delay in the conversation (waiting for the other person to respond). Above 300ms, people will start 'talking over' each other because of the lag."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:609
msgid "Jitter - Stability of the Connection"
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:610
msgid "Jitter is the 'shaking' of your latency. It measures how much the delay between packets changes over time."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:614
msgid "We use the RFC 3550 algorithm (Standard for RTP). It doesn't just look at the highest and lowest values; it calculates the difference between consecutive packets and applies a smoothing filter."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:615
msgid "Formally: J = J + (|D| - J) / 16, where D is the difference between the current and previous packet delay. This provides a stable 'moving average' of network stability."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:619
msgid "Phones expect audio packets to arrive in a steady 'heartbeat' (every 20ms). If Jitter is high (>30ms), packets arrive in 'clumps' or too late to be played. This causes the voice to sound 'robotic', 'choppy', or broken."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:622
msgid "MOS - The 'Voice Score'"
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:623
msgid "MOS (Mean Opinion Score) is a 1.0 to 4.5 rating that predicts how a human would rate the call quality."
msgstr ""

msgid "How we calculate it:"
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:627
msgid "We implement a simplified ITU-T G.107 'E-model'. It takes your current Latency, Jitter, and Packet Loss, and calculates an 'R-factor'. This factor is then mapped to the MOS scale."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:629
msgid "- 4.3 - 4.5 (Excellent): Crystal clear HD audio, like sitting in the same room."

msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:631

msgid "- Packet Loss: The most critical metric. If a packet is lost, a piece of someone's word is gone forever. VoIP cannot 'redownload' lost audio like a file transfer does."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:641
msgid "- Outliers: These are packets that didn't go missing but took much longer than usual (more than 3 standard deviations from the mean). In a call, these cause a temporary 'freeze' or a loud 'pop' in the audio."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:642
msgid "- Streak: Shows how many times in a row a host has responded (S) or failed (F). Long 'F' streaks mean the connection is completely down."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:646
msgid "While 1% loss might be okay for browsing, for VoIP it means every 100th piece of a word is missing. Above 2-3% loss, the conversation becomes extremely difficult to understand."
