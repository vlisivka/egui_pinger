msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:665
msgid "- Median (Middle Value): We sort all results and pick the one in the middle. This is the 'typical' experience. If you have 100 packets and 1 of them is very slow, the Median stays the same, while the Mean jumps up."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:666
msgid "- 95th Percentile (P95): This shows the worst-case scenario for 95% of your traffic. If P95 is low, your connection is stable. If it's much higher than the Median, your connection is 'jittery' and prone to sudden lags."

msgid "VoIP Impact:"
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:670
msgid "Voice is a real-time stream. If latency is over 150ms, you start to notice a delay in the conversation (waiting for the other person to respond). Above 300ms, people will start 'talking over' each other because of the lag."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:673
msgid "Jitter - Stability of the Connection"
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:674
msgid "Jitter is the 'shaking' of your latency. It measures how much the delay between packets changes over time."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:678
msgid "We use the RFC 3550 algorithm (Standard for RTP). It doesn't just look at the highest and lowest values; it calculates the difference between consecutive packets and applies a smoothing filter."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:679
msgid "Formally: J = J + (|D| - J) / 16, where D is the difference between the current and previous packet delay. This provides a stable 'moving average' of network stability."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:683
msgid "Phones expect audio packets to arrive in a steady 'heartbeat' (every 20ms). If Jitter is high (>30ms), packets arrive in 'clumps' or too late to be played. This causes the voice to sound 'robotic', 'choppy', or broken."

msgid "MOS - The 'Voice Score'"
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:687

msgid "How we calculate it:"
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:691
msgid "We implement a simplified ITU-T G.107 'E-model'. It takes your current Latency, Jitter, and Packet Loss, and calculates an 'R-factor'. This factor is then mapped to the MOS scale."

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:693
msgid "- 4.3 - 4.5 (Excellent): Crystal clear HD audio, like sitting in the same room."

msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:695

msgid "- Packet Loss: The most critical metric. If a packet is lost, a piece of someone's word is gone forever. VoIP cannot 'redownload' lost audio like a file transfer does."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:705
msgid "- Outliers: These are packets that didn't go missing but took much longer than usual (more than 3 standard deviations from the mean). In a call, these cause a temporary 'freeze' or a loud 'pop' in the audio."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:706
msgid "- Streak: Shows how many times in a row a host has responded (S) or failed (F). Long 'F' streaks mean the connection is completely down."
msgstr ""

#: ./scripts/../src/main.rs:710
msgid "While 1% loss might be okay for browsing, for VoIP it means every 100th piece of a word is missing. Above 2-3% loss, the conversation becomes extremely difficult to understand."
